# Jackpot using random module
A brief description of what this project does
### INTRODUCTION:
* Jackot is a slot maachine based game.
* User can play this game just like real-world slot machine.
### OBJECTIVE OF PROJECT:
* To use and understand Python's random module.
* To build coding-logic.
### WORKING:
1. User firstly enter the amount to play with which must be >=200 otherwise user will get promt again and again
2. To spin user will be charged $100
3. User gets $200 if he wins Jackpot i.e. all three numbers should be equal
4. User gets $80 if he wins Round i.e. each number should be >+1 to previous one and first number should not be 0
5. User gets $50 if he wins Pair i.e. any two numbers must be same
6. User gets $10 if number1<number2<number3
7. If user have balance <=80 he/she will get promt to add more money to play otherwise he/she could simply quit
8. This game may cause addiction so play at your own risk
### CONCLUSION:
* I learned and understood how to use Python's random module.
* Also developed coding-logic to provide to interaction with user.

NOTE: Code is comment out to understand logic better.
